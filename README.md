# GMSNN

## [Under development] Neural network framework for Game Maker Studio 2

A part of my freshman Computer Engineer work. This framework is stripped from a complete project so some part might not work correctly.

### Features

- Supervised learning focus on game solving AI.
- Support 3 types of activation function (tanh, softmax, sigmoid).
- Support multiple game instances run in parallel.
- Simple network visualization.
